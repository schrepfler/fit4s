# fit4s #

Welcome to fit4s!

This library should provide a Scala API on top of the Fit SDK. At the moment it just converts fit files into csv files, mostly for Michals device and use.

In order to build fit4s you will need to download the Fit SDK from https://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit, unzip it and put the fit.jar library into ./lib
